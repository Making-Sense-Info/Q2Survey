# Questionnaires Working Group 2024 survey

This repository contains the [results](https://making-sense-info.github.io/Q2Survey/) of the [DDI Questions and Questionnaires working group](https://ddialliance.org/membership/working-groups-%26-committees) 2024 survey.

The results are provided as a [web page](https://making-sense-info.github.io/Q2Survey/) and a notebook (`survey.py`).

The notebook itself is a [Marimo](https://marimo.io) notebook and can be run with the command `rye run up` at the root of the project (running involves at least to have [rye](https://rye.astral.sh) and Python installed).
