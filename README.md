# Questionnaires Working Group 2024 survey

This repository contains the results of the [DDI Questions and Questionnaires working group](https://ddialliance.org/membership/working-groups-%26-committees) 2024 survey.

The results are provided as a notebook (`survey.py`) and as various outputs, the main being a single web page with tables and charts.

The notebook itself is a Marimo notebook and can be run with the command `rye run up` at the root of the project (running involves at least to have rye and Python installed).
