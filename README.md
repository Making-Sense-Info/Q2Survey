# Questionnaires Working Group 2024 survey

This repository provides:

- the [results](https://making-sense-info.github.io/Q2Survey/survey.html) of the [DDI Questions and Questionnaires working group](https://ddialliance.org/membership/working-groups-%26-committees) 2024 survey,
- the [agenda](https://making-sense-info.github.io/Q2Survey/eddi-workshop.html) for the group workshop at EDDI24.

The results are provided as a [web page](https://making-sense-info.github.io/Q2Survey/) and a notebook (`survey.py` in the code repository).

The notebook itself is a [Marimo](https://marimo.io) notebook and can be run with the command `rye run up` at the root of the project (running involves at least to have [rye](https://rye.astral.sh) and Python installed).

The agenda is a work in progress and will only be a proposal, the group could provide suggestion for a different modus operandi.
