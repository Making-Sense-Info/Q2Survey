# EDDI 24 Q2 workshop

From [EDDI program description](https://events.geant.org/event/1637/timetable/#57-ddi-alliance-questionnaires):

> Do you document questionnaires with DDI-Lifecycle? The DDI Questions and Questionnaire Working Group invites you to participate in a workshop to discuss how the DDI Alliance can make use of the standard easier for you.

> The session will include discussions on what you wish DDI-Lifecycle could do, and what aspects are most challenging when documenting questionnaires. The outputs will be used to; 1) improve the DDI standard 2) provide insights into where improved guidance is needed 3) feed into the DDI Developers Working Group for potential new light weight tooling.

## Ice breaker

- Let's divide into groups of 4/5 people (3 if we are less than 10)

- After 5/10 minutes someone from the group will present the word and give a small explanation
